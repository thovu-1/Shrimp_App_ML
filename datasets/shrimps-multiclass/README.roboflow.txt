The dataset includes 26822 images.
Dwarf-Shrimp are annotated in Multi-Class Classification format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -9째 to +9째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -33 and +33 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
