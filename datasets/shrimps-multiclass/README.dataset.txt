**Project Overview:**
The Caridina and Neocaridina Shrimp Detection Project aims to develop and improve computer vision algorithms for detecting and distinguishing between different shrimp varieties. This project is centered around the use of caridina and neocaridina shrimp as a dataset for developing and refining computer vision models.

Caridina shrimp and neo-caridina shrimp are two distinct species that require different water parameters for optimal health. Neocaridina shrimp are generally more hardy and easier to keep than caridina species, while caridina shrimp are known for their striking patterns. The body structure of both species is similar, and there are specific patterns that can be used to compare and assess the sensitivity of the model.

**Descriptions of Each Class Type:**
The dataset for this project includes thirteen different class types. To begin with, the neo-caridina species have been grouped together to test if the model can distinguish between caridina and neo-caridina shrimp. The remaining classes are all different types of caridina shrimp.

The RGalaxyPinto and BGalaxyPinto varieties are both caridina shrimp, with the only difference being their color: one is red and the other is black. Both varieties have distinctive spots in the head region and stripes on their backs, making them ideal for testing the model's ability to distinguish between color. The Panda Bee variety, on the other hand, is known for its panda-like pattern and is included in the dataset to see if the model can distinguish between black and red patterns as they tend to have more color stripes then white. The CRS-CBS Crystal Red Shrimp and Crystal Black Shrimp have similar patterns to the Panda Bee shrimp, but the hues are different. Panda shrimp tend to be a deeper and richer color than CRS-CBS shrimp, CRS-CBS tend to have more white stripes then color.

Within the Caridina species, there are various tiger varieties. These include Fancy Tiger, Raccoon Tiger, Tangerine Tiger, Orange Eyed Tiger (Blonde and Full Body). All of these have stripes along the sides of their bodies. Fancy Tiger shrimp have a similar color to CRS, but with a tiger stripe pattern. Raccoon Tiger and Orange Eyed Tiger Blonde look very similar, but the body of the Raccoon Tiger appears larger, and the Orange Eyed Tiger is known for its orange eyes. Tangerine Tigers vary in stripe pattern and can often be confused with certain neo-caridina, specifically yellow or orange varieties.

The remaining are popular favorites for breeding and distinct color patterns namely Bluebolt, Shadow Mosura, White Bee/Golden Bee, and King Kong Bee.

Current Status and Timeline:
The current scope of the project is to narrow the focus to pattern/color distinguishing and identify the thirteen classifications that can produce preliminary results. The project is targeting a conclusion by the end of May.

Contribution and Labeling Guidelines:
To contribute to this project, please follow these labeling guidelines:

    All images should be high-resolution and clearly show the shrimp in question.
    Images should be labeled with the appropriate class type.
    If there are multiple shrimp in an image, please label each one separately.
    In the case of shrimp with similar patterns or colors, please use your best judgement to assign the appropriate label.

Thank you for your contributions to this project. Your efforts will help to improve computer vision algorithms for detecting and distinguishing between different shrimp varieties.
